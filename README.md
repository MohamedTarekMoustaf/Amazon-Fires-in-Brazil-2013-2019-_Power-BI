✨ Key Features

Interactive Map Visuals
Color-coded column charts on the map show total fires by state and year.

Yearly Trend Analysis
State-level columns display changes in fire frequency from 2013 to 2019.

Rose (Polar) Pie Chart
The Rose chart in the top-right corner provides a circular breakdown of total Amazon fires by year.
Why it’s useful:

Each segment represents a year, and the radial length highlights the proportion of fires that year.

The rose layout makes it easy to spot years with unusually high activity at a glance, e.g., 2017–2019 stand out with longer petals compared to quieter years.
